# CpMultiplane docs

Documentation of [CpMultiplane][2], the small PHP front end for the fast and headless [Cockpit CMS][1].

Writing the docs needs a lot of time, especially for all the edge cases with multiple sub page collections and multilingual setups. I try, to keep it up to date, but I do most the work in my spare time. Feel free to ask questions in the issues section.

Currently (2019-10-19) I focus on writing missing (basic) features and cleaning up the code. Sometimes I have to restructure parts of the code. You should always read the [CHANGELOG][3] before you update to a later version.
